# Crash-Course-on-Python
Python is a versatile programming language essential for automation, enabling the creation of short scripts for automated tasks, utilizing fundamental structures like strings, lists, and dictionaries, and allowing the development of custom Python objects.

# Module 1
- Define the terms computer program, programming language, script, and automation
- Use the print() function to output data to the screen
- Explain the difference between the syntax and semantics of a programming language
- List some of the characteristics of the Python language
- Utilize basic Python arithmetic operators to obtain the results of mathematical expressions

# Module 2
- Differentiate and convert between different data types utilizing variables
- Define and call functions utilizing parameters and return data
- Refactor code and write comments to reduce complexity and enhance code readability and code reuse
- Compare values using equality operators and logical operators
- Build complex branching scripts utilizing if, else and elif statements

# Module 3
- Implement while loops to continuously execute code while a condition is true
- Identify and fix infinite loops when using while loops
- Utilize for loops to iterate over a block of code
- Use the range() function to control for loops
- Use nested while and for loops with if statements
- Identify and correct common errors when using loops

# Module 4
- Manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and formatting
- Use lists and tuples to store, reference, and manipulate data
- Leverage dictionaries to store more complex data, reference data by keys, and manipulate data stored
- Combine the String, List, and Dictionary data types to construct complex data structures

# Module 5
- Demonstrate object-oriented programming using classes and objects
- Implement classes with custom attributes and methods
- Write docstrings to document classes and methods
- Leverage inheritance to reduce code duplication
- Import and use Python modules to access powerful classes and methods

# Module 6
- Tackle more complex problems from the ground up using a framework
- Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
- Conduct research into options for tackling the problem
- Plan an approach to solving the problem
- Write a complex script in order to implement a solution
